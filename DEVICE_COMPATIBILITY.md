### Memory Optimization

The app automatically optimizes data storage based on chip type:

- **NTAG213**: Best for simple URLs and text (up to 132 bytes)
- **NTAG215**: Suitable for contact info and game saves (up to 492 bytes)
- **NTAG216**: Ideal for detailed receipts and complex data (up to 876 bytes)

## Technical Implementation

### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android Configuration
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Includes NFC permissions and hardware requirements
- **Permissions**: `android.permission.NFC` and `android.hardware.nfc` (required)
- **NFC Manager**: Uses `react-native-nfc-manager` v3.16.2

#### iOS Configuration
- **Info.plist**: Added NFC capabilities with proper entitlements
- **NFC Usage Description**: User-friendly permission prompt
- **ISO7816 Select Identifiers**: Support for payment card emulation
- **NFC Reader Session Formats**: Support for TAG and NDEF formats

### Compatibility Checking

The app includes a built-in compatibility checker that:

1. **Device Detection**: Automatically detects the current device type and capabilities
2. **NFC Verification**: Checks if NFC is available and enabled
3. **Chip Support**: Validates support for all NTAG chip variants
4. **Terminal Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with supported payment terminals
5. **Warning System**: Provides warnings for potential compatibility issues

### Key Features

#### Battery Optimization
- Event-driven NFC activation to minimize battery drain
- Low-power mode when not actively scanning
- Optimized polling intervals based on device capabilities

#### Memory Management
- Automatic chip type detection
- Optimal data chunking based on memory constraints
- Compression support for larger data sets

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error detection and reporting
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions

## Usage Instructions

### Checking Device Compatibility

1. Open the NFC Wallet App
2. Look for the "ðŸ“± Device Compatibility" section
3. Tap the "Check" button to verify compatibility
4. Review the compatibility status and any warnings

### NFC Tag Scanning

1. Ensure your device is compatible (check via the compatibility section)
2. Tap "Scan NFC Tag" button
3. Bring NFC tag close to device
4. The app will automatically detect and process the tag

### Supported Operations

- **Read Operations**: Compatible with all NTAG chip types
- **Write Operations**: Automatic memory optimization based on chip type
- **Payment Processing**: Secure integration with supported terminals
- **Receipt Generation**: Optimized for different memory sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### NFC Not Available
- **Symptom**: "NFC is not available or enabled"
- **Solution**: Enable NFC in device settings and ensure hardware support

#### Device Not Compatible
- **Symptom**: Compatibility check shows issues
- **Solution**: Check device specifications and ensure it matches supported devices

#### Memory Limitations
- **Symptom**: Data too large for chip
- **Solution**: Use appropriate chip type or reduce data size

#### Terminal Communication Issues
- **Symptom**: Payment terminal not responding
- **Solution**: Ensure terminal is in supported list and properly configured

### Compatibility Warnings

The app provides warnings for:
- Untested device configurations
- Low battery levels affecting NFC performance
- Memory usage approaching chip limits
- Network connectivity issues for online verification

## Development Notes

### Adding New Device Support

To add support for new devices:

1. Update the `getDeviceCompatibilityMatrix()` method in `eventDrivenNFCManger.ts`
2. Add device specifications and capabilities
3. Test compatibility checking functionality
4. Update documentation

### Chip Type Extensions

To support new NTAG chip types:

1. Add chip information to `getNTAGChipInfo()` method
2. Update memory optimization logic
3. Test with physical chips
4. Update compatibility documentation

## Security Considerations

- All compatibility checks are performed locally
- No sensitive data is transmitted during compatibility verification
- Device information is used only for compatibility determination
- User privacy is maintained throughout the process

## Future Enhancements

- Expanded device compatibility matrix
- Real-time compatibility updates
- Advanced memory optimization algorithms
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Support for additional NFC standards

## Support

For compatibility issues or questions:
1. Check the in-app compatibility checker
2. Review device specifications against supported devices
3. Ensure app is updated to latest version
4. Contact support with device model and error details
